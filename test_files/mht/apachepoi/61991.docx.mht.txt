Next Generation Clinical Trial Transparency: Providing Management and Analysis of RNA Sequencing DataLabKey has begun work with long-time partner the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) to further clinical trial transparency by providing public and internal access to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and Next Gen Sequencing data related to clinical trials being conducted by the network. In addition to providing direct access to sequencing data, this effort will connect raw data to downstream sequence analysis and visualizations that incorporate clinical data and other assay data through ITN’s research web portal, ITN TrialShare.
