PHP WordPHPWord is a pure PHP library for reading and writing Word, ODT, and RTF files. This file is the source file to test the read/write capabilites of PHPWord.PHPWord can apply font formats such as bold, italics, color, underline, strikethrough, subscript, superscript, or highlighted. You may also notice that there’s one text break (empty paragraph) before this one that can be created also by PHPWord i.PHPWord can also format paragraph such as this justified, 12pt before and 12pt after with 1.5 lines spacing paragraph. This formatting can be applied inline or using predefined style as we use to do in Word.
