The overall Open XML file format SDK takes on the layered approach. The following diagram illustrates the overall SDK components. The low level layer contains stream reads/writes, Open XML DOM, Open XML Packaging API and Open XML Syntax Validation. This document outlines the low level layer functionalities.1.1.1 Architectural DesignThe SDK low level contains a low level DOM, readers, writers and an event mechanism. The low level DOM has 2 parts: the framework and generated classes. The framework defines the base classes and object hierarchy of the low level layer. The generated classes represent a strongly typed XML DOM for Open XML schema.For design details, please view the design documents: Stage2 Low Level Design, Framework Design, Framework Classes, Rules of Code Generator.
