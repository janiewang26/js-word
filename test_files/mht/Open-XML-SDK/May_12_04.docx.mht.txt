In addition, research is encouraged to develop methodologies to improve the accuracy, efficiency, scope, timeliness, and analytic yield of drug abuse epidemiologic data.  Because of the breadth of epidemiology research, applications are anticipated to reflect diverse and multidisciplinary putative approaches and multiple levels of causation.NIH: TESTING TOBACCO PRODUCTS PROMOTED TO REDUCE HARMhttp://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-04-103.html		(PA-04-103)The purpose of this Program Announcement (PA) is to stimulate multidisciplinary research on potential reduced-exposure tobacco products, both smoked and smokeless, through the interplay of basic, biological, and behavioral research, surveillance, and epidemiology. The tobacco industry is currently promoting some new products with claims that they are less harmful or less addictive because these products purportedly deliver lower amounts of toxic, carcinogenic, and/or addictive agents to the user compared with conventional products. However, to date, the scientific evidence is insufficient to evaluate whether these new products actually reduce the users’ exposure or risk for tobacco-related diseases. The key research question of this PA is, “Do potential reduced-exposure tobacco products provide a truly, less-harmful alternative to conventional tobacco products, both on the individual and population level?”SAMHSA: $45 MILLION AVAILABLE TO LAUNCH STRATEGIC PREVENTION FRAMEWORK www.samhsa.gov/grants/index.html 	Deadline: July 2, 2004		(SP 04-002)The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announces $45 million in cooperative agreements with states to implement a new Strategic Prevention Framework to advance community-based programs for substance abuse prevention and mental health promotion.

The fund's 2004 Promoting Policy Change sub-cycle will support efforts to change and shape drug policies through advocacy, community mobilization, and education.  The fund seeks to broaden public and political support for drug policy reform and will fund strategic and innovative approaches to increase such support. The fund  invites proposals designed to motivate policy makers to  embrace and promote alternatives and reforms to current  local, state, or national drug policies; mobilize and  empower organizations and constituencies working to promote  drug policy reform; promote better awareness and under-  standing of alternatives to current drug policies; and  broaden awareness and understanding of the extent to  which punitive prohibitionist policies are responsible  for most drug-related problems around the country. The fund will provide both general operating support and project-specific grants. All grantmaking will be directed to organizations working within the U.S., with particular emphasis on state-based activity. Strategic, geographic, or thematic collaborations are strongly encouraged. The total amount available to the 2004 Promoting Policy Change cycle is roughly $1.25 million; approximately two-thirds will be earmarked for distribution to organizations working on state-based drug policy reform.NEWS AND NOTICES     	                                                                                             TOPNIH: SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF DATA ON CAM USE IN MINORITY POPULATIONShttp://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-AT-04-005.html	(NOT-AT-04-005)This provides update on previous solicitation. SABBATICALS IN WASHINGTON, DChttp://www.opm.gov/Career_Opportunities/index.asp	If you are interested in taking a sabbatical here in DC or finding a government position (career transitions) or even have access to special opportunities for your students, there is a useful website that shows the possibilities, including career tips and suggestions.  ONLINE RESOURCES     	                                                                                             TOPAARP REPORTS, BULLETINhttp://research.aarp.org/il/beyond_50_il.html "A Report to the Nation on Independent Living and Disability," by Mary Jo Gibson, Marc Freiman, Steven Gregory, Enid Kassner, Andrew Kochera, Faith Mullen, Sheel Pandya, Don Redfoot, Audrey Straight and Bernadette Wright (AARP Public Policy Institute, Beyond 50.03, April 2004, PDF format, 213p.).BOSTON COLLEGE CENTER FOR RETIREMENT RESEARCH ISSUES IN BRIEFhttp://www.bc.edu/centers/crr/ib_16.shtmlPopulation Aging: It's Not Just the Baby Boom," by Alicia H. Munnell (IB #16, March 2004, .PDF format, 7p.). "The retirement of the baby boom - those people born between 1946 and 1964 - is almost upon us. The leading edge of this famous cohort turns 62 in 2008. With the aging of the baby boom, the population of the nation is about to gray rapidly over the next three decades. The purpose of the brief is to put the baby boom and its impact on population aging in perspective. Specifically, the baby boom is not the reason for the aging of the population; the aging is the result of long-term trends of increasing longevity and declining fertility. The bust/boom/bust pattern in fertility rates that resulted in the baby boom simply changes the path to an older society. Thus, the baby boom is not "a pig in a python," a somewhat graphic metaphor frequently used to suggest that the large cohort is just passing through, and life will return to normal once the last member dies. Rather, the nation is facing a permanent change in its demographic profile."THE GREEN BOOK 2004 – POLICY DATAhttp://waysandmeans.house.gov/Documents.asp?section=813 US HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE COMPENDIUM: _Green Book: 2004_ (.PDF format) have been released by the House Ways and Means Committee.

They address the question "How much did the intervention impact the individuals who received it, relative to those who did not?" Often, consumers are tempted to treat the results of the statistical tests as effect sizes, regarding statistically significant effects as if they were important and statistically non-significant effects as if they were unimportant. Unfortunately, the test of statistical significance is not a good indicator of how much an intervention mattered, because it actually confounds two pieces of information: the size of the intervention's effect and the size of the sample. Very important effects may be statistically non-significant when sample sizes are small, and very trivial effects may be statistically significant when sample sizes are large. The most common types of effect sizes are the (1) standardized mean difference (d), (2) correlation coefficient (r), and (3) odds ratio. To learn more about interpreting effect sizes and about meta-analysis in general, see Lipsey & Wilson's (2001) Practical Meta-Analysis.

Until recently, most brain experts thought the human command center stopped growing at around 18 months and that neurons were pretty much set for life by age 3. In fact, the brain's gray matter has a final growth spurt around the ages of 11 to 13 in the frontal lobes of the brain, the regions that guide human intellect and planning. But it seems to take most of the teen years for youngsters to link these new cells to the rest of their brains and solidify the millions of connections that allow them to think and behave like adults. At the same time, the release of adolescent hormones during and after puberty causes other areas of the brain, particularly the amygdala, which governs basic emotional response, to fire up or expand. The result is that teens look at things differently than adults. This has tremendous implications for education, mental health, drug abuse and moral and legal responsibility of adolescents. Deborah Yurgelun-Todd of Harvard Medical School and McClean Hospital in Boston has studied how teenagers and adults respond differently to the same images. They usedfunctional magnetic resonance imaging of the subject's brains and found a stark difference in the parts being used. Adults used both the advanced prefrontal cortex and the more basic amygdala to evaluate what they had seen; younger teens relied entirely on the amygdala, while older teens (top age in the group was 17) showed a progressive shift toward using the frontal area of the brain. There is more evidence of the differences:• A recent imaging study by researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that teens taking an experimental gambling test are less likely to activate a region in the base of the brain that motivates behavior to work to obtain rewards than a control group of young adults, ages 22-28, playing the same games.• Numerous studies show alcohol and perhaps other drugs hit teen brains harder than they do adult brains. The frontal lobes and the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation, are particularly vulnerable.• It has been known for some time that children have sharp growth spurts in brain connections among regions specialized for language and spatial relationships between ages 6 and 12. That language capacity tends to reside mostly in a person's nondominant side _ the left hemisphere of the brain in right-handers, for instance. But a recent imaging study by researchers at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center found that this distinction ends in the mid-20s when the brain shifts to use both sides in language processing.The story of teen brain development lies in a process called myelinization, in which a layer of fat coats wire-like fibers connecting regions of the brain, back-to-front, side-to-side, and everywhere in between. Over time, this makes the operation of the brain more precise and efficient, affecting not just thinking and problem-solving, but also coordination and mastery of skills ranging from throwing a baseball to playing the trombone. The new understanding of adolescent brains also leads to questions of ethics and legalities. The Supreme Court already has decided that people should not be executed for crimes committed when they were age 15 or younger, and in the fall is scheduled to consider whether the restriction should be extended to everyone under 18.JUVENILE AWARENESS PROGRAMS DON'T SCARE KIDS STRAIGHT Anthony Petrosino and Carolyn Turpin-Petrosino found that attempts to scare kids straight by taking them on tours of prison facilities, and interacting with adult offenders, does not prevent crime.  They previously reported in their C2 review of May 2002 that the experimental groups (attending these tours) commit more crimes, on average, than the control groups that received no intervention (http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/doc-pdf/ssa.pdf). The update, in accord with C2 guidelines, extends the search strategies, adds additional analyses, and again reports the same result: according to these experimental studies, doing nothing to kids is better than exposing them to a juvenile awareness or "Scared Straight" program.

Among its findings, the report, Attitudes and Practices Concerning Effective Philanthropy, by researcher Francie Ostrower, found that among foundations that say it is important to collaborate with external groups, 41 percent had not participated in a formal co-funding arrangement in the past two years and 34 percent had not convened people from outside the foundation to inform foundation activities. Similarly, among those that say formal evaluations of funded work are important for effectiveness, fully 33 percent did not conduct them. And of those that say it is important to solicit outside advice, 62 percent had not solicited grantee feedback through surveys, focus groups, or interviews. An executive summary (20 pages, PDF) of the report, which was funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation in partnership with Grantmakers for Effective Organizations, can be downloaded from the Urban Institute Web site.LIVING WILLS DON'T WORK: TIME TO ABANDON FAILED POLICY IN FAVOR OF DURABLE POWERS OF ATTORNEY(From EurekAlert, 5/10/04)The failure of the living will is highlighted in an article that will be published this week in the new issue of the bioethics journal the Hastings Center Report by a University of Michigan internal medicine researcher and a professor of law and internal medicine. What they find is provocative: The documents designed to help people choose the treatments they would like when dying fail to meet five key criteria for success. Worse, the evidence suggests they don't work. They base their conclusions on a comprehensive review of hundreds of studies of living wills, end-of-life decisions and the psychology of making choices….The U-M team (Fagerlin and Schneider) can imagine circumstances where the living wills may be useful for patients who are imminently facing death, who know their medical circumstances and who have strong and specific beliefs about them. But the researchers conclude that living wills offer a false promise of control over end-of-life treatment. The best patients can do, the researchers argue, is to use a "durable power of attorney" to appoint someone to make decisions for them when they can no longer make their own decisions. The living will, Fagerlin explains, was designed by bioethicists who wanted to give patients a chance to spell out what treatment they would want and what treatment they would reject if they became unconscious or unable to make their own decisions for some other reason. The idea of the living will is to allow people to maintain control even at the end of life……The functional illiteracy of many Americans, and the difficulty even for skilled writers of expressing their wishes well, add to the problem, Fagerlin notes. And, people's preferences often change as their situations or medical technology changes. For most people, Fagerlin and Schneider say, a durable power of attorney for health care may be adequate. DPA's allow people to name someone whom they would want to make decisions about their care. That person is usually the patient's spouse or child, but it can be any trusted individual. IASWR LISTSERV INFORMATIONIASWR Online ArchivesIASWR Upcoming EventsTo Subscribe to the IASWR Listserv: Send email to LISTSERV@LISTSERV.SC.EDULeave subject line blank and type in message area:Subscribe iaswrlst firstname lastnameTo Unsubscribe from IASWR Listserv: Send email to LISTSERV@LISTSERV.SC.EDULeave subject line blank and type in message area:Signoff iaswrlstInstitute for the Advancement of Social Work Research750 First Street, NE, Suite 700Washington, DC 20002Phone: 202-336-8385 Fax: 202-336-8351Email: iaswr@naswdc.orgWeb site: www.iaswresearch.orgIASWR Listserv Announcements                                                              May 12, 2004                                                      2
