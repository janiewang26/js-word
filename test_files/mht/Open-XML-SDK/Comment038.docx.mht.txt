On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your document. You can use these galleries[AA1][AA2][AA3] to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look.
