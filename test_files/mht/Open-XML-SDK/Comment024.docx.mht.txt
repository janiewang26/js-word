Word 15 has a bunch of improvements [PA1][derekr2][PA3][derekr4]to the commenting scenario. In addition to an improved look and feel, you now have the ability to reply to comments and to mark them as “done.” One of the coolest things is that Word shows you a [derekr5]lot more information about who authored a comment.  To try it out you can install the Office Dogfood Manager - just make sure your User Name in Word Options is the same as your name on Exchange.   [PA1]I like this new feature.  Have I covered everything?[derekr2R1]So do I! I really like being able to reply to comments now. Looks great.[PA3R1]Very cool.  Thanks Peter![derekr4R1]Don’t forget to also try our People integration—thanks, PCX![derekr5]I added a missing word and removed a duplicate word here. Feel free to mark this comment as done once these changes have been noted ☺
