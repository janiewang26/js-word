This document is created for revision testing.We need cover the following aspects:1. The revision could be insertion, deletion, move,  formatting and comment2. The revision could be done to main document, header and footer, text box, header and footer text box, footnote, end note. I’m not sure if there’re any places or content types could be tracked, but of course I will keep investigating this feature and update this item accordingly.3. Track changes could be turned off, but the tracked changes will not be removed. It just discards changes happen after that.4. I found the compare and combine feature in Word 2007. Compare can help us compare the revised document with original version which is sent out for review while Combine merge revisions in several documents derived from same document into one. Is it possible to use these two features in verifying output of Document Assembly process?5. A document could be protected from formatting and editing (while in review) and the restrictions could be granulated further. May we have to take it into account when testing Protect Document.6. The balloon setting should be testing as well.
