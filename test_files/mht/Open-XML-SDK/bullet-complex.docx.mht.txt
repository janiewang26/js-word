Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property OrganizationHumanity faces a global crisis in the governance of knowledge, technology and culture.  The crisis is manifest in many ways. * Without access to essential medicines, millions suffer and die;• Morally repugnant inequality of access to education, knowledge and technology undermines development and social cohesion;* Anticompetitive practices in the knowledge economy impose enormous costs on consumers and retard innovation;* Authors, artists and inventors face mounting barriers to follow-on innovation;➢ Concentrated ownership and control of knowledge, technology, biological resources and culture harm development, diversity and democratic institutions;* Technological measures designed to enforce intellectual property rights in digital environments threaten core exceptions in copyright laws for disabled persons, libraries, educators, authors and consumers, and undermine privacy and freedom;* Key mechanisms to compensate and support creative individuals and communities are unfair to both creative persons and consumers;* Private interests misappropriate social and public goods, and lock up the public domain. Signing the Geneva Declaration on the Future of WIPO (as of September 30, 2004)
